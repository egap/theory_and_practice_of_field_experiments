Recent awards and trials in development economics have re-ignited active discussions of the ethics of these trials.

@techreport{Asieduetal2021ethics,
	abstract = {Ethics in social science experimentation and data collection are often discussed but rarely articulated in writing as part of research outputs. Although papers typically reference human subjects research approvals from relevant institutional review boards, most recognize that such boards are not comprehensive ethical assessments. We propose a structured ethics appendix to provide details on the following: policy equipoise, role of the researcher, potential harms to participants and nonparticipants, conflicts of interest, intellectual freedom, feedback to participants, and foreseeable misuse of research results. We discuss each of these, and some of the norms and challenging situations of each. We believe that discussing such issues explicitly in appendices of papers, even if briefly, will serve two purposes: more complete communication of ethics can improve discussions of papers and can clarify and improve the norms themselves.},

@book{bretz2011,
	abstract = {Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics,
		  Multiple Comparisons Using R describes the common
		  underlying theory of multiple comparison procedures through
		  numerous examples. It also presents a detailed description
		  of available software implementations in R. The R packages
		  and source code for the analyses are available at
		  http://CRAN.R-project.org After giving examples of
		  multiplicity problems, the book covers general concepts and
		  basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the
		  Bonferroni method and Simes' test. It then shows how to
		  perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear
		  models and general parametric models. It also introduces
		  the multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient
		  interface to perform multiple comparisons in a general
		  context. Following this theoretical framework, the book
		  explores applications involving the Dunnett test, Tukey's
		  all pairwise comparisons, and general multiple contrast
		  tests for standard regression models, mixed-effects models,
		  and parametric survival models. The last chapter reviews
		  other multiple comparison procedures, such as
		  resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential
		  or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple
		  comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling
		  multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making
		  and safeguards against false claims. A self-contained
		  introduction to multiple comparison procedures, this book
		  offers strategies for constructing the procedures and
		  illustrates the framework for multiple hypotheses testing
		  in general parametric models. It is suitable for readers
		  with R experience but limited knowledge of multiple
		  comparison procedures and vice versa. See Dr. Bretz discuss
		  the book.},
