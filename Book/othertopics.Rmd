# Other Topics {.tabset}

Here we provide links to resources to help people learn about topics that cannot be covered in-depth during the workshop but are important for experimental design.

## Core content
 
- Workflow
  - People have limited memories, we need rules and tools to help us remember and share
  - Reproducibility relies on efficient and clear coding and archiving

- External validity
  - A lot of this book deals with internal validity. 
  - This does not immediately help you extrapolate to other populations. 
  - What are the trade-offs? How can I extrapolate?

- Randomization Inference and procedures in ri2
  - Randomization inference is a method for calculating p-values for hypothesis tests
  - ir2 is an R package that allows you to run the simulation for calculating RI p-values for various estimands

- Reading results
  - How to understand and interpret regression output? 
  
- Integrating qualitative research 

- Adaptive designs
  - Most designs are static: ie the same procedures for allocating treatments and measuring outcomes are applied throughout the trial. 
  - Adaptive designs adjust the allocation treatment and control assignment based on interim analysis of the trialâ€™s result.

- Meta analysis
