# Governance of The Repository

The current authors (as of Feb 2024 the current authors are Nahomi Ichino, Maarten Voors and Jake Bowers) will decide to accept or reject changes to this repository via unanimous agreement. They will also decide whether a new contribution merits inclusion of that contributor as an author.  All current authors commit to deliberate quickly so that proposed changes receive responses without undue delay.

Once a person becomes an author, they receive full authority: rather than unanimous agreement among three people, for example, when a fourth person is added, decisions about changes would then be governed by consensus among four people. We can imagine changing the governance model if the number of authors make consensus and unanimity unweildly.
